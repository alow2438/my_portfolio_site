    <h3>What does an MA in English, an entry level position in marketing, and learning to code have in common?</h3>
    </div>
   <div>
       <p>The simple answer, is me! In 2014 I recieved my Masters in English from Truman State
    University. Unlike my colleagues, I wanted to persue a career outside
    of teaching. I eventually landed an entry level job in Marketing as 
    a Marketing Coordinator for a small consumer electronics company.

      <p>While there have certainly been aspects of Marketing that I love, I have realised that due to the nature
    of my small company's business model, I haven't actually gained many lucrative marketings skills. 
    Having looked for the past year or so at marketing positions, I felt like I would
    end up doing the same work, which had grown tedious, for someone else and this
    wasn't what I wanted. </p>
    </div>

    <p> Knowing my struggle to find career satisfaction, my friend, a coder, suggested I look into
        LaunchCode. While I had used a small amount of HTML within my marketing role, I had never
        thought about doing more with it.
